1. What are the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript ?  Find some more details about pop-boxes?
Popup boxes are used in JavaScript to display information or messages to the user on your website. It is also known as a dialog box.
You can use a popup box to show some alert or warning message, take confirmation from the user and get input from the user. The user cannot proceed to see other web pages or perform some actions on your site until the popup box is closed by him. 
In JavaScript, there are 3 different types of popup boxes.
-->Alert Box
This popup or dialog box is used to display an alert or warning message to the user. To proceed, the user must click “OK.”
We use the alert() method of the window object to show an alert dialog box in JavaScript.

		Syntax
		window.alert(message);
		or
		alert(message);

-->Confirm Box
It is a popup box used to get permission or confirmation from the user. There are two buttons in the confirm box: “OK” and “Cancel”. To continue, the user must select either “OK” or “Cancel”. It returns true if the user clicks on the “OK” button, otherwise, then false is returned.

In JavaScript, we use the window’s object confirm() method to take consent from the user.

		Syntax
		window.confirm(message)
		or
		confirm(message)

-->Prompt Box
It is a dialog or popup box which is used to get some input from the user before allowing them to move on to the next step. This popup box has an input field, “OK” and “Cancel” buttons.

We use the prompt() method of the window object in JavaScript to take input from the user. The prompt() method takes two parameters: the message you want to display and the default value. The value returned by prompt() is stored in a variable and used to execute some action.

		Syntax
		window.prompt(your message,default_value)
		or
		prompt(your message,default_value)
The default_value parameter is optional.

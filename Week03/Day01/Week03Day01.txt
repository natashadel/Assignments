1. How to add or remove css classes to html elements using javaScript? Check with example.

We can use the classList property to manipulate CSS classes using JavaScript. It is a read-only property that returns a live DOMTokenList collection of all the classes applied to the element.
The classList property works in all modern browsers and IE10 and above.
You can use the classList property to easily add, remove, and toggle CSS classes from an element in vanilla JavaScript.
--> add() method: The add() method adds one or more classes to the HTML element:
			Eg:-var el = document.getElementById("div1");

				// Adding Single class
				el.classList.add("my-class");

				// Adding Multiple calsses
				el.classList.add("my-class", "my-another-class"); If you try to add a class that already exists, the add() method will ignore it.

--> remove() method: The remove() method is used to remove one or more classes from the element:
			Eg:-var el = document.getElementById("divID");
					// Removing class
					el.classList.remove("my-class"); If you try to remove a class that doesn't exist, JavaScript will completely ignore it.

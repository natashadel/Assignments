1. Array methods in JavaScript Find(), FindIndex() and Filter()
The findIndex() method in JavaScript is used to search an array for an element that matches a specific condition, and returns the index of the first element that matches the condition. This method takes two arguments: a callback function that defines the condition to be matched, and an optional this value that will be used as the this value for the callback function.

The find() and findIndex() methods are like filter() in that they iterate through your array looking for elements for which your predicate function returns a truthy value. Unlike filter(), however, these two methods stop iterating the first time the predicate finds an element. When that happens, find() returns the matching element, and findIndex() returns the index of the matching element. If no matching element is found, find() returns undefined and findIndex() returns -1.

-->Find()
Use array ‘find’ method to traverse through the array to get a result of single entity when the condition matches for very first time else returns ‘undefined’.
Loop executes only till the first match. CallbackFn is run even for indexes with unassigned values.

-->FindIndex()
Use array ‘findIndex’ method to traverse through the array to get an integer result of ‘index number’ when the condition matches for any entity for first time else returns ‘-1’.
Loop executes only till the first match. CallbackFn is run even for indexes with unassigned values.

-->Filter()
Use array ‘filter’ method to traverse through the array to get results of all entities for which the condition matches else returns empty array ’[]’.
Loop executes for all the entities. CallbackFn doesn’t run for indexes with unassigned values.

The main difference between findIndex vs indexOf in JavaScript is that findIndex accepts a callback as an argument, and indexOf accepts a value as an argument. What this means is that indexOf will only ever look for a value in an array, whereas findIndex will let you decide how you find the index. 
Use findindex() for conditional loops when you don't know the position of the array item. Use Indexof() when you know the position of the array item.

1.  What is eval() method in JavaScript? How to use it? Check with an example?
eval() is a global function in JavaScript that evaluates a specified string as JavaScript code and executes it.
-->Eg:- eval("alert('this is executed by eval()')");
eval can convert string to JSON object. The eval() method evaluates or executes an argument.
If the argument is an expression, eval() evaluates the expression. If the argument is one or more JavaScript statements, eval() executes the statements.
eval() is an ECMAScript1 (ES1) feature.

2. What is the difference between   "this" and  $(this) in jquery programming?
'this': In JavaScript, this keyword is used to refer to the object it belongs to. The value that this stores is the current execution context of the JavaScript program.
Thus, when used inside a function thisâ€˜s value will change depending on how that function is defined, how it is invoked and the default execution context.

$(this): It also refers to the object it belongs to. Basically, both are the same. But when this keyword is used inside $(), then it becomes a jQuery object, and now we can use all properties of jQuery on this method.

The this Keyword is a reference to DOM elements of invocation. We can call all DOM methods on it. $() is a jQuery constructor and in $(this), we are just passing this as a parameter so that we can use the jQuery function and methods.

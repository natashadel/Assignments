1.  How to add events to html elements at runtime  using javascript?
There are lots of standard and event attributes you can use with a element. If you want to use multiple event attributes on single element then it would not be feasible or a good idea to add those in a element. It will not be good for readability and maintenance.

In this case, you can just use addEventListener function to attach an event attribute to an element without adding attribute to the element directly.

        </p>
        <script>
           const button = document.getElementById("btn2");
           button.addEventListener('click', function () {
            alert("Hello Button");
           });

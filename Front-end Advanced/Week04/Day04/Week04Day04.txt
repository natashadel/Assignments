1. What is Regular Expression in JavaScript? How to validate email id using Regular Expression?
Regular expression is a sequence of character which define a specific pattern and also named as abbreviated regex or regexp and sometimes called a rational expression. 
Using regular expression in JavaScript, you can easily validate the email address before submitting the form. 
Approach 1:

RegExp – It checks for the valid characters in the Email-Id (like, numbers, alphabets, few special characters.)
It is allowing every special symbol in the email-id (like, !, #, $, %, ^, &, *) symbols in the Email-Id but not allowing the second @ symbol in ID.

Approach 2:

RegExp – It checks for the pattern like anything@anything.anything
RegExp is accepting every character along with special character multiple times.


Eg:- function validateEmail(email){
    	var reg = /^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@([A-Z0-9-]+\.)+[A-Z]{2,4}$/i;
    	if(reg.test(email)){
        return true;
    	}
    	alert('Please enter valid email.');
    	return false;
     }

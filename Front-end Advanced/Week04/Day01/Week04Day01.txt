5. Difference between Client side JavaScript and Server side JavaScript?
Client-side means that the JavaScript code is run on the client machine, which is the browser. Server-side JavaScript means that the code is run on the server which is serving web pages. One runs in the browser (client side), the other runs on the server

Client-side components usually consist of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ajax, JS libraries, images, and whatever other files that are to be downloaded to the browser. On the server, you need a listener to process requests, fetch resources or information, and manipulate them so that they can be sent back to the client, like Node.js.

Client-Side JavaScript (CSJS) -- an extended version of JavaScript that enables the enhancement and manipulation of web pages and client browsers

Server-Side JavaScript (SSJS) -- an extended version of JavaScript that enables back-end access to databases, file systems, and servers

Core JavaScript -- the base JavaScript language

Client-Side JavaScript (CSJS) and Server-Side JavaScript (SSJS) are dependent on the core JavaScript and cannot work without it.

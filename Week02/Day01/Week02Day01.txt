1. Why do you use position property in CSS? 

The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky). The position property is used to align the different elements in the HTML page. 
Position Property plays an important role to make high-quality web pages.Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.

2. What is the difference between position property values :  absolute / relative?

-->Position: relative
An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

-->Position: absolute
An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.

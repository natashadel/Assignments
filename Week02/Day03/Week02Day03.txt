Search engines use web crawler programs as their helpers to browse the Internet for pages before storing that page data to use in future searches.

3. Why do you use backlinks in SEO?
Backlinks are links that lead from another website to your own. In other words, these links aren’t on your website — they lead to your website from somewhere else on the Internet. When it comes to SEO, sites seek backlinks to earn credibility within their industry. They’re a useful tool for bringing traffic to your site.
Backlinks serve as an endorsement or “vote of confidence” of your site, which can increase trust. Backlinks are one of the most influential ranking factors used by search engines.
